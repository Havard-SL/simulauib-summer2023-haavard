\subsection{Improvements}

TODO: Better construction 
TODO: Improve upon the counterexample of AAut for ab. Experimentally it is not true for groups, but what about loops?
TODO: Better code, maybe only generate the reduced forms, or one representative from each ``class'' whatever that is. Maybe something with fingerprints? Loops? Abelian?

\subsection{Crazy ideas}

\begin{idea}
    One of my more crazy ideas is to try and use the Eckmann-Hilton argument to show when a permutation is an automorphism, since from \autoref{thm:quasi-automorphism-iff-self-conjugate} would imply that \( *_Q \) and \( *_{\phi(\tilde{Q})} \) are equal if and only if \( \phi \in \Aut(Q) \).
\end{idea}

\begin{idea}
    TODO: Maybe can use compounding knowledge in attack to get lots of values in the table for every value checked? i.e if have 3 different \( \phi^{-1}(x_i) \) values, can then check 2 choose 3 different \( x_i +_{\tilde{Q}} x_j  \) values.
\end{idea}

\subsection{Observations}

TODO: Intersections of Aut of abelian groups. Always equal to one of them or just id?

TODO: Experiments imply AAut not preserved under isomorphism by the 5x5 example specifically between \( s_{44915} \) and \( s_{85427} \). but no proof.

TODO: Fingerprint and affine fingerprint, what is their deal?

\subsection{Future experiments}

TODO: Check if for every permutation, there is a loop where it is an AAut. Could connect with \autoref{remark:ab-aaut-counterexample-notes}.

\subsection{Maybe irrelevant stuff}

TODO: Non-identity automorphism for every abelian group.
